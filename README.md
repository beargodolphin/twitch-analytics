# twitch-analytics
This project involved an analysis of Twitch gaming data from January 1st 2015 to uncover patterns and trends. Using SQL for data querying, key questions were answered and insights were provided into the dataset from Twitch. I then employed Python, using libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to visualise the data and present my findings in an engaging and informative manner.

The analysis focused on various aspects of Twitch streaming, including peak viewing times, popular games, streamer performance, and audience engagement. By transforming this raw data into actionable insights, I identified significant trends that can inform content strategy and optimise viewer engagement for streamers. With the final outcome concluding that the streamers best strategy was to play League of Legends at around midday.
